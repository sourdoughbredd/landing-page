# Landing Page

A modern and responsive (beginner-level) landing page for showcasing services.

## Description

This project is a simple, responsive landing page built with HTML and CSS. It features a navigation bar, a hero section with a background image, and a services section with images and descriptions. It is a home page only, so do not expect the interactive elements to function.
